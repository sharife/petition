There should be a category on the App Store to reflect that.""Scott Snibbe, whose apps are in the Whitney and MoMA’s permanent collection","Steve Jobs sometimes called his computers works of art, and he’s inspired generations of digital creators with Apple’s elegant hardware and software. It would honor his passion for expanding the boundaries of art to add an Art category to the App Store.""Mark Tribe, artist, founder of Rhizome and chair, SVA MFA Fine Arts",Apple should create an Art category in the App Store. Duh!"Megan Newcome, Director of Digital Strategy, Phillips","Apple's legacy of breaking new ground in technologies and tools that inspire creative expression is manifest in adding 'Art' to the App Store. Also, what Mark Tribe said.""Magdalena Sawon, co-owner, Postmasters Gallery, NYC","For over thirty years I have witnessed artists' search for new forms of creative expression, and they are often the first to use the current technologies to transform and enrich culture. It's time to have an Art category among the apps, the medium more and more artists are exploring.""Julia Kaganskiy, Director, NEW INC at New Museum","It's ironic that for all of Apple's visionary integration of design and engineering, they still fail to recognize and embrace the essential importance of art in our lives and to celebrate the marriage of art and technology that takes place on their platform, by giving Art its own category in the App Store.""Douglas Rushkoff, media theorist, writer, columnist",Art and commerce don't have to be at odds - but neither do they have to be the same thing."Roddy Schrock, Director, Eyebeam","Eyebeam has worked to fuse art and technology for nearly 20 years -- in that time digital practice has become commonplace. An Art category in the App Store is an obvious benefit for creators as well as Apple. After all, it's artists that truly test and expand the boundaries of what Apple's machines can do.""Joshue Ott, Interval Studios, creator of Thicket and the Variant apps",It’s always painful to categorize our artworks as “Entertainment.” This is an opportunity for Apple to give people a place to discover Art and showcase creative new uses of their technology.
